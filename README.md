# README for vim_8.0_snap
This is a snap for Vim (Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX
editor Vi) so that it can be run on Ubuntu Core 16. This snap is meant to be
used as a reference on how-to create snaps for Ubuntu Core 16 and as such
should not be used in a production environment. As with anything you find on
the internet please proceed with caution as you never know when Gremlins,
Goblins, or Trolls will appear.  

## How to install  
Install the snap using the following command:  
sudo snap install vim_8.0_amd64.snap --devmode  
## How to run  
From the command prompt run "vim"
